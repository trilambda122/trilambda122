# Profile for Shane Schilling

Business, like life, can be a sea of competing needs and goals. As a mission-driven technology executive, I strongly believe in cultivating dedicated work cultures that provide a clear focus on overall vision and objectives. With 20+ years of progressive leadership experience, I blend in-depth business acumen with a broad understanding across the technical landscape to deliver sustained organizational growth in established and startup environments.

Combining strategy with tactical execution, I drive operational excellence and revenue generation by developing thoughtful, straightforward solutions as well as the steps needed for implementation. The genuine relationships that I build with stakeholders at all levels facilitate trust, collaboration, and adaptability as I spearhead operational launches, enhancements, and problem solving. 

Committed to continuous learning, I seek opportunities for myself and my team to grow in business, technology, and leadership, thereby positioning individuals for current and long-term success
